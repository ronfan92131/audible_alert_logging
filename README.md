# audible_alert_logging
For driving test, it is unsafe to look at the logging while driving. If convert the key state changes into an audible alert, the tester can just listen to the audible alert to know
the module status, without even looking at the computer screen. 
This porject demonstrates such a tool with beep.py.  it reads the tail end of logging file sys.argv[1], play an audible alert for each key states.
